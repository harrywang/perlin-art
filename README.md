# Perlin Noise Art Generator

This project generates beautiful Perlin-noise-based art using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). I use [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) to generate most of the code based on the the original [Processing](https://processing.org/) code from [here](https://github.com/sighack/perlin-noise-fields), which was described in this blog post: [Perlin Noise Fields](https://github.com/sighack/perlin-noise-fields).
